# Choice

Choice is *the* answer to the question of, "what is indeed many when two or more but same as none when it is one." 

Having only one choice or option to choose from is logically, figuratively, literally and semantically the same as not having any choices. 

## Essence of Decision Making 

The essential nature of choosing from available options (i.e. decision making) is to evaluate combinations or permutations afforded by the given options. 

The process of evaluating options can then yield a decisive action that causes the situation, containing the options and the decision maker, to evolve.

To withhold or appear to withhold actions is in itself a decisive action. Therefore non-action is not definable but, can be approximately defined as motionlessness.
